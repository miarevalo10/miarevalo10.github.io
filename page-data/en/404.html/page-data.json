I'm from Arauca, Colombia. It's a little country town with warm weather on the border with Venezuela. Since I was little I wanted to dedicate my life to build tools that have impact in the world. It was until the end of my high school that I discovered the great power that IT has and how this would be the perfect way to make my mark. From a small program to carry expenses to a large application to coordinate various entities and help in decision-making. The possibilities are immense in this ever changing world!","experience-title":"Experience","contact-me":"Contact me: ","notfound.header":"NOT FOUND","notfound.description":"You just hit a route that doesn't exist... the sadness."},"routed":true,"originalPath":"/404.html","redirect":false,"defaultLanguage":"en"}}}}
